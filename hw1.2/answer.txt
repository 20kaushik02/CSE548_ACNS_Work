Vernam created what came to be called "on-line encipherment" (because it was done directly on the open telegraph circuit) to distinguish it from the old, separate, off-line encipherment. He freed a fundamental process in cryptography from the shackles of time and error. He eliminated a human beingthe cipher clerkfrom the chain of communication. His great contribution was to bring to cryptography the automation that had benefited mankind so much in so many fields of endeavor. These values were immediately recognized, and Ver-nam's idea quickly kicked up a flurry of activity. He put it down on paper in a sketch dated December 17.
