mile Vinay and Joseph Gaussinthough not with the speed and ease of a typewriter keyboard. Rather it was the assimilation of encipherment into the overall communication process. Vernam created what came to be called "on-line encipherment" (because it was done directly on the open telegraph circuit) to distinguish it from the old, separate, off-line encipherment. He freed a fundamental process in cryptography from the shackles of time and error. He eliminated a human beingthe cipher clerkfrom the chain of communication. His great contribution was to bring to cryptography the automation that had benefited mankind so much in so many fields of endeavor. These values were immediately recognized, and Ver-nam's idea quickly kicked up a flurry of activity. He put it down on paper in a sketch dated December 17. A.T. & T. notified the Navy, with which it had worked closely in a communications demonstration the previous year, and on February 18, 1918, Vernam, Parker, Lyman F. Morehouse, equipment

ater intrusion detection systems used adaptive meth-ods involving neural networks and Petri nets to improve their detection abilities.One system, IDIOT [538], monitors audit logs looking for a sequence ofevents that correspond to an attack. An alternative point of view, used by the STATsystem [456], is to ignore the actual states and focus on the commands that changethem. Researchers at the Univer
